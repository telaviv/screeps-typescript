Features
----------------------------

[ ] - Long Distance Energy Mining
[ ] - Mineral Extraction
[ ] - Room Defense
   [ ] - Change the routing in a room while under attack
   [ ] - Have no path caching
   [ ] - Have pathing ignore edges and attackers
[ ] - Build non-swamp roads with the builder and no one else when there's nothing better to build
[x] - Scouting
   [x] - Write function that gets closest rooms from a list of rooms
   [x] - Create a data structure called ScoutedFeatures that talks about some aspects of a room visited
      [x] - Optional features include:
         [x] - owner
         [x] - controllerLevel
         [x] - hasInvaderCore
         [x] - enemyThatsMining
   [x] - Every 24 hours a scout is sent out to rooms distance 2 and 36 hours for rooms 3 distance away
      [x] - Scout is sent from room sorted by distance->highest level
[x] - Autoclaim
[x] - Link Usage
   [x] - Record data about which link is for what
   [x] - First 3 links should be about sending energy to the storage
   [x] - Create a static link hauler to move stuff from link to the storage
   [x] - create a static controller upgrader
[x] - Workers can wall repair really weak walls
[x] - Logistics become workers when preference doesn't work.
[x] - Builders don't make construction sites, the build manager does
[x] - Auto build spawn when we don't have one.

   [x] - Links
   [x] - Visualizer
   [x] - Storage

[x] - Safe Mode Usage
[x] - Hauler
[x] - Bunker
   [x] - Add the bunker to a new "stamps" folder
   [x] - Implement distance transforms. Only cache them when visualizing
      [x] - 1) Distance from walls
      [x] - 2) Distance from sources and controller
      [x] - 3) Sum of source + controller transforms
      [x] - 4) We pick a spot far enough from the walls to place the bunker with a minimum sum distance

Optimizations
----------------------------
[x] - Clear the immutable room cache for old game times
[ ] - TransferTask.create gets all tasks every time one is created. Cache this!!
[x] - Pickups from closest
[ ] - No Builders if unneeded

Nice To Have
----------------------------
[ ] - Color code Logger
[ ] - Have a manager assign jobs to available workers instead of having workers search for their own jobs
