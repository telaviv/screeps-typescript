# Cursor Rules for screeps-typescript

## Code Quality Standards

### Pre-commit Checks
Before any code changes are considered complete, always run:
```bash
yarn precommit
```

This command runs:
- Prettier formatting
- ESLint fixes
- Unit tests
- Build/compilation

All checks must pass before the code is ready to commit. If any check fails, fix the issues before proceeding.

### Type Safety
- Use type guards instead of unsafe type casts (e.g., `as unknown as`)
- Prefer proper type definitions over `any`
- Add type annotations when TypeScript can't infer types

### Import Organization
- Follow the `sort-imports` ESLint rule
- Group imports logically (external libraries, internal modules, types)
- Keep imports alphabetically sorted within groups
